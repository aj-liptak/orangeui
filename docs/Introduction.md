# Introduction

OrangeUI is a rapid development javascript framework for soundly built web applications. It's composed of a series of modules allowing you as the developer to pick and choose how much your application will lean on the framework.

OrangeUI provides the following:

- Object-oriented javascript objects
- Event mixin for objects
- HTML5 wrapper functions
- Module dependency management
- A real-time or RESTful data persistence layer w/offline mode
- Customizeable models
- Controllers with DOM helper functions
- View fragment loader w/ templating
- Live data bindings
- History and route management
- Standardized UI controls

Dependencies include:

Log4js - for logging
Modernizr - for feature detection
jQuery - for AJAX and DOM Selectors
Socket.io - for real time data

The goal of this framework is to give you a customizable base for building your web application that completely decouples your data sources from your controller logic and presentation. In addition, it allows the creation of reusable components to speed up development time. OrangeUI sets up standards for how to organize your application code, decouple your styles and UI elements, and interact with web services.
